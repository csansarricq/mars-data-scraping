  # mars-data-scraping
This project is split into two parts:
Part 1:
  Using BeautifulSoup to scrap data from the website- https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html 
  to pull information about the titles and preview of text.
  Storing the data that we scraped into a list of dictionaries.

Part 2:
  Using the BeautifulSoup to scrap data from the website- https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html
  and create a HTML table that was extracted to create a DataFrame to conduct analysis on the data of Mars that is provided.
  Analysis include-
    The month with the lowest and highest temperature.
    The month with the lowest and highest atmospheric pressure.
    How many terrestrial days in a Martian year.
